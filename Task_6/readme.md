Task 6: Infrastructure as a Code

Task 6 involves creating basic resources using Terraform, which is pre-installed in Cloud Shell. After checking the Terraform version and creating a main.tf file, a Compute Instance is created with the help of a provider. The state file is generated and checked using the terraform plan and terraform apply commands. The created resource is also removed using Terraform. The final part involves creating additional resources such as a Cloud Storage bucket, Compute Instance, and Cloud SQL instance with Postgres engine, along with making changes to the database and uploading an index.html file to the bucket. The instructions also include the optional step of installing Terraform locally and using a service account for credentials.
