Task 3: Creating and Executing a Cloud Function on GCP.


For Task 3, the user was required to create and execute a cloud function on Google Cloud Platform. The user had to create a new function, set the trigger to HTTP, and select Python3.7 as the runtime.  After the deployment, user could copy the URL from the Trigger tab and paste it in a browser to run the function. Finally, the user had to paste the trigger URL into the task_3_cloud_function file in their cloud_challenge repository and commit and push the changes to their remote repository.
