Task 4: Creating and Hosting a Static Website on a Virtual Machine.

Task 4 involves creating and hosting a static website on a virtual machine instance on Google Cloud Platform. The user creates a virtual machine instance, installs a web server on it, and hosts a static website. They connect to the instance, install and configure Apache web server, and create their own index.html file. Finally, the user copies the public IP address of the instance and pastes it into AirTable to avoid exposing it in a public code repository.
