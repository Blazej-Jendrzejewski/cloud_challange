Task 5: Creating and Using Cloud SQL Instance


Task 5 involves creating a Cloud SQL instance on Google Cloud Platform, customizing it by allowing public IP access and creating a schema with a table. You will then use Dbeaver to connect to the database and create, insert, update, and select data. The final tasks include adding a new column to the table, inserting additional rows, calculating the average age of the students, and committing the extracted data to a TXT file in a new folder in your cloud_challenge repository.


Answer from the task: The average age of the students in the class is 31 years.
